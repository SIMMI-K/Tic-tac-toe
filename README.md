## Features 
1. Game Board:
Grid Layout: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, making up 9 squares in total.
Cell States: Each square in the grid can be in one of three states: empty, marked with an "X," or marked with an "O."
2. Players:
Two Players: The game is played between two players. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O."
Turn-Based: Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square on the grid.
3. Objective:
Winning Condition: The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row. This can be achieved horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw Condition: If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
4. Gameplay:
Simple Controls: The game is easy to control, usually involving simple clicks or taps to place a mark in the desired square.
Immediate Feedback: The game provides immediate feedback on each move, updating the board with the player's mark and checking for a win or draw.
5. Game Flow:
Starting Player: Typically, one player is randomly chosen to start, or the players can decide who goes first.
Alternating Turns: Players alternate turns until the game ends.
Restart Option: After a game ends, players can reset the board to play again.
6. Winning and Draw Scenarios:
Three in a Row: A player wins if they can align three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
Draw: If the board is full and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
